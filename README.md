# Multi-Sensor Image (infrared and visible) Fusion using deep learning framework, PCA, DWT

A banking API allows you to transfer money between two accounts. 

### Requirements
- [MatConvNet](https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)
- [imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19](https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/)
- [Wavelet Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/wavelet.html)

### Note
If you want to find the ratios, you have to run the code the long way. The ratios are already exist in the ratio.txt file.
